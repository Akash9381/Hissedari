                                        Fractional real estate investment is an innovative way to invest in real
                                        estate assets. It refers to the legal sharing of property among multiple
                                        owners. The property title is divided in a manner that each investor owns a
                                        fraction of the real estate asset. The investors earn monthly rentals and
                                        benefit from appreciation in the value of the asset.

                                        Fractional ownership is a model of Investment in which several unrelated
                                        parties can share in the risk, rewards and ownership of a high-value
                                        tangible asset (like real estate). In simple terms, by investing INR
                                        20,00,000 in a INR 20,00,00,000 asset you will get the ownership of 1% of
                                        the asset. Fractional ownership, unlike full ownership, allows customers to
                                        diversify their portfolio, access high-worth investment avenues, reduce
                                        capital constraints and hedge risks.

                                        The first thing you will need is a Hissedari.com account which is KYC
                                        verified.
                                        <p>Once verified, a virtual account will be created and you can now invest
                                            in any open opportunity listed on the platform.</p>

                                        <p>To do so, all you need to do is just a click on the ‘Invest Now’ button
                                            and confirm your investment details.</p>

                                        <p>If you decide to move forward and block your investment, you will need to
                                            e-sign a binding Expression of Interest (EOI) and transfer the initial
                                            10% token advance to a virtual account, which you will find on your
                                            dashboard.</p>

                                        <p>You will receive all necessary property and SPV-related documents for

                                        <p>Once 100% commitment is received from interested investors, the
                                            opportunity is considered to be fully funded.</p>

                                        <p>You will then be required to transfer the remaining amount into your
                                            virtual account.</p>

                                        <p>Your investment amount will then be routed through an escrow mechanism to
                                            the share subscription accounts and ultimately, to the current account
                                            of the SPV.</p>

                                        <p>You will be allocated equity shares and compulsorily convertible
                                            debentures (CCDs) in the Private Limited Company.</p>

                                        <p>The SPV will then proceed to purchase the asset.</p>

                                        Yes, you can visit any asset chosen for investment. As pre-leaded assets
                                        premises are operational facilities for the tenants and hence constant
                                        visits can become a hindrance for the tenant. However, we are working on a
                                        tech solution to enable virtual tours of the premises.

                                        <p>Your investment is in the form of equity shares and compulsorily
                                            convertible debentures in a Private Limited Company, incorporated for
                                            the sole purpose of acquiring and owning the asset by virtue of holding
                                            equity shares in the SPV, you are true owner of the asset.</p>

                                        <p>The SPV is bound to comply with statutory requirements such as holding
                                            general meetings, filing returns, etc., that are undertaken by
                                            third-party consultants. Due to this structure, the ultimate
                                            decision-making power lies with the investors alone.</p>

                                        <p>As the asset is registered as a separate entity and Hissedari.com simply
                                            acts as an asset manager, Hissedari.com could be replaced by another
                                            asset management firm that would continue to provide the same services
                                            as Hissedari.com. Thus, even if Hissedari.com is not functional, your
                                            ownership and control of the asset remain secure and even the records

                                        A TRC is a Tax Residency Certificate provided by the country where you are
                                        currently residing. India has a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with
                                        almost all major countries that reduce TDS to lower thresholds of 10-15%
                                        (depending on the provisions of the DTAA). However, the benefit of the
                                        reduced tax rate is only available to users who are able to produce a TRC.
                                        Please speak to your tax advisor on how you can procure a TRC for your
                                        country of residence.

                                        physical share certificates are not issued. This is normal practice in the
                                        industry. An electronic receipt is sent out for each transaction so that you
                                        can keep a copy of those for your records. Also, your ownership through SPV
                                        is documented (a) with Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the records cannot
                                        be manipulated.

                                        REITs are publicly traded instruments. Investors buy and sell units of the

                                        <p>Whereas with Hissedari.com Investors are made shareholders of a Private

                                        <p>In a REIT, the yield varies based on your entry price. With
                                            Hissedari.com, the yields are fixed.</p>

                                        <p>As a listed product, a REIT is subject to stock market volatility which
